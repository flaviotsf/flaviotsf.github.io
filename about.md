<p class="message">
  Hi there. I'm Flavio, a Solutions Architect at ATD, the <a href="http://www.atd.org">Association for Talent Development</a>.
</p>

I hold a MSc from [George Washington University](http://www.gwu.edu) in Systems Engineering
and have an undergraduate degree in Industrial Engineering from UFRJ ([Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escola_Polit√©cnica_da_UFRJ)). I'm passionate about making things
and will share some of these with you.

Before joining ATD I worked at [Telarix](http://telarix.com) where I helped build their new pricelist exchange system called iXLink and
also test iXTools, a premier interconnect solution for the Telecom industry. Going back even further, I worked at
[Mercatto](http://www.mercatto.com.br), a retail store in Brazil, where I created many tools and processes to improve efficiency and profitability. 
In a few years they've grown from 9 stores in Rio to over 90 all over Brazil. It was great
being part of that fast-paced growth environment.


Before Mercatto, I worked as an intern at [Record](http://www.record.com.br/grupoeditorial.asp), one of the largest book publishers in Latin America.
I've worked closely with upper management where I learned how to prioritize and create easy data digests with indicators of performance.

If you'd like to get in touch feel free to add me on Twitter [@flaviotsf](http://www.twitter.com/flaviotsf) and send me a message!
