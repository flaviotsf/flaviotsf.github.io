At ATD I've always seen folks run around gathering reports for our
annual conference. Observing that, I thought it would be a great idea
to create a simple dashboard that not only contained the data up to now
but also would have an estimate of how many more conferences we would sell.

This little dashboard was a huge success and is still used today. Of course
some improvements were made to the projection algorythm since then, taking
in consideration different factors like early bird rates and so on.

Here is an example (numbers were blurred since they are proprietary information).

With the widespread usage of visualization tools, like [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com),
it will make sense move this predictive dashboard into one of those tools
which will allow for a far greater analysis including adding segmentation criteria
as filters, for example.
