At ATD I've always seen folks run around gathering reports for our annual conference. Observing that, I thought it would be a great idea to create a simple dashboard that not only contained real-time data but also had a predictive component
This little dashboard was a huge success and is still used today. As usual, we keep tweaking the prediction algorithm usually by adding more variables to the mix (e.g. early bird schedules, promotions, etc.).
Here is an example (numbers were blurred since they are proprietary information).

The widespread growth of visualization tools, including [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com), makes for a far easier filtering and segmentation logic. As Tableau users, we definitely plan on moving this from a .NET solution to a Tableau dashboard. I think this looks pretty good for a system created way back in 2011 :)
