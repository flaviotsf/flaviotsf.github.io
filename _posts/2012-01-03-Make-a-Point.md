Make a Point was a very cool system to work on. It started with a simple idea:
can we create a web form for people to submit praise to their coworkers to HR?
Then we may let them exchange these by gift cards.

I thought the idea was great, but a form by itself would not create a level
of engagement that we were looking for.

So I thought: Why not create a simple system where folks can not only submit their
praises, and at the same time keep track of what's happening at the company?

This is how Make a Point looks today:

We've also made the site resposive and added some special tags so it can be
added to iPhones and Androids as a webapp. This way you can send points anytime.

Finally, I built an admin section for our HR department so they can track and
manage employees and run reports.
