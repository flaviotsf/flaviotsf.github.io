Make a Point was created from a simple idea:
*Can we create a web form for people to submit praise about their coworkers to the Human Resources department?*
The company would reward these employees with gift cards.

I thought the idea was great, but a form by itself would not create a level
of engagement that we were looking for.

So I thought: Why not create a simple system where folks can not only submit their
praises but and at the same time keep track of what's happening in the company?

This is how Make a Point looks today:

I've blurred the feed on the right where anyone can see who is receiving points and also find out what great work they have done.

We've also made the site responsive and added some special tags so it can be
bookmarked to iPhones and Androids as a webapp. This way anyone can send points anytime.

Finally, I built an admin section for our HR department so that they can manage data and run reports.
