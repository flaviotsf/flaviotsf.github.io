Make a Point was a very cool system to work on. It started with a simple idea:
can we create a form for people to 'praise' their coworkers? Then we may let
them exchange praises by gift cards.

I thought the idea was great, but a form by itself would not create a level
of engagement that we were looking for.

So I thought: Why not create a simple system that folks can see who is receiving
praise and all?

This is how Make a Point looks today:

We've also made the site resposive and added some special tags so it can be
added to iPhones and Androids as a webapp. This way you can send points anytime!

Finally, I built an admin section for our HR department so they can track and
manage employees and run reports.
