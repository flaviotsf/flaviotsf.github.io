At work, we had an awesome workshop on applying David Allen's [*Getting Things Done*](http://gettingthingsdone.com)
to our daily routines.

GTD relies heavily on Outlook: organizing folders, setting up tasks, etc. The main issue I had was that
we used an independent ticketing system at work so my Outlook Tasks were not giving me a comprehensive
view of what was on my plate.

So I thought... Why not have a unified view inside Outlook? To do that I created
a simple Outlook Add-in that displays all openend tickets as well as their details.
Parature's APIs were not very well documented at the time nor fully featured
but I managed to get what I wanted done. With Microsoft's acquisition, things seem to be getting better on that end.

This was a huge time-saver for me and others who spend a decent amount of time using both systems.

**Many folks use the add-in on a daily basis.**

One process change I made recently was to start tracking projects and other
larger enhancements in [Trello](http://www.trello.com).
Having a board visualization greatly improves communication with the team and upper management.
