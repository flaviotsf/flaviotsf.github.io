title: Parature Outlook Add-in

We had an awesome workshop on applying David Allen's [*Getting Things Done*](http://gettingthingsdone.com)
to our daily routines at work.

GTD realies heavily on Outlook: folders, tasks, etc. The issue I had was that
we use a ticketing system at work so my Outlook Tasks were not giving me a unified
view of what's on my plate.

So I thought... Why not get those tickets inside Outlook? To do that I created
a simple Outlook Add-in that shows openend ticket items as well as their details.
Parature's APIs were not very well documented at the time (seems that after
Microsoft acquired them that things are getting better) nor fully featured
but I managed to get what I wanted done.

This was a huge time-saver and made sure the team didn't drop the ball on any
opened item.

**Many folks use the add-in on a daily basis!**

One change I made since its creation was to start tracking projects and other
larger enhancements in [Trello](http://www.trello.com).
Having a board display is a great communication
tool between team members and upper management. We're following a basic KANBAN
flow - using Trello - and it has been working great for us!
