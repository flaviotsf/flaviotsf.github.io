Tweetsheet was a few hours weekend project. I wanted an easy way to record
in and out times (for my timesheet).
I thought about using geofencing and iBeacon (to honestly play with iBeacon more than
  doing a timesheet app) but settled with designing a Mac OSX toolbar app.

I've written an [article on Medium outlining Tweetsheet](https://medium.com/@flaviotsf/tweetsheet-a-twitter-based-timesheet-dd45091db6b2). Check it out!

And yes, I'm still thinking of some cool usages for iBeacon :)
