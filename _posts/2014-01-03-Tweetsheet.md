Tweetsheet was a quick weekend project. Could I create an easy way to record my timesheet times without relying on my memory nor wasting too much time?

As a geek, my first idea was to use geofencing and iBeacon. When I entered my office the system would know I'm there!

Hummm... what about meetings, lunch, etc? I settled to create a simple Mac that lives on my task bar.

I've written an [article on Medium outlining Tweetsheet](https://medium.com/@flaviotsf/tweetsheet-a-twitter-based-timesheet-dd45091db6b2). Check it out!


And yes, I'm still thinking of some cool/non-standard usages for iBeacon :)
