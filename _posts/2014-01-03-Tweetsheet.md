Tweetsheet was a quick weekend project. Could I create an easy way to record my timesheet times without relying on my memory nor wasting too much time?

As a geek, my first idea was to use geofencing and iBeacon. When I entered my office the system would automatically log my entry time. Sounds easy, right? What about meetings, lunch, etc? There were too many edge scenarios.
I decided to 'keep it simple' and created a Mac task bar app.

I've written an [article on Medium outlining Tweetsheet](https://medium.com/@flaviotsf/tweetsheet-a-twitter-based-timesheet-dd45091db6b2). Check it out!


And yes, I'm still thinking of some cool/non-standard usages for iBeacon :)
