Together with the ATD team and a vendor we redesigned the Education section
of our site.

The goal was to facilitate registration and make it easy for folks to find the program that best fit their needs.

To do that, we made sure our landing page had many entry points to our
facetted search page. We also ensured to have many filter options
for our users varying from topic, location, and price among others.


We have also spent a good amount of time on our program detail pages, making sure they
were easy to digest but still contained all the information necessary to promote additional sales.


Finally we added functionality such as a Learning Roadmap (assessment) and facilitator search pages.

*Adding a program to your cart is easy.*

![Facilitator Search](/public/edu-fac-search.png)
*Among other things, we allow searching for facilitators.*

*Our program detail page. We used [static Google Maps images](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/) to show the location while
not embedding tons of dynamic maps that would make the page load slower.*
