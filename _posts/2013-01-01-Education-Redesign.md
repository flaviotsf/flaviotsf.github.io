Together with the ATD team and a vendor we redesigned the Education section
of our site.

The goal was to make it easy for folks to find the best program for them
and to make registration easy.

To do that, we made sure our landing page had many entry points for our
facetted search page. We also ensured to have many filter options
for our users varying from topic, location, price among others.


We also spent a good amount of time on our program detail pages, making sure they
were not overly long but still contained all the information necessary
for someone to be able to tell if a certain program is right for them.


We also worked on lots of other pages and functionality including our Learning Roadmap,
Facilitator search pages and all. Check out the [ATD Education](http://www.astd.org/Education) site!

not taxing performance.*
