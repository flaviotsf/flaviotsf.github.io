Together with the ATD team and a vendor we redesigned the Education section
of our site.

The goal was to make it easy for folks to find the program that fit their needs the best. We should also make registration easy.

To do that, we made sure our landing page had many entry points for our
facetted search page. We also ensured to have many filter options
for our users varying from topic, location, price among others.


We also spent a good amount of time on our program detail pages, making sure they
were easy to digest but still contained all the information necessary
for someone to be able to tell if a certain program is right for them.


Finally we added functionality including a Learning Roadmap (assessment),
facilitator search pages, among others. Check out the [ATD Education](http://www.astd.org/Education) site!

*Our program detail page. We used [static Google Maps images](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/) to show the location while
not taxing performance.*
