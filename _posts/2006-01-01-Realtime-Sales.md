Real-time Sales was a project I worked on way back in 2006. I had the idea of adding real-time information from some of Mercatto's retail stores.

This system was a **huge** success. It completely changed the way management would act on information. Beforehand, upper management had to rely on phone calls or simply waiting for store’s data to be transferred to HQ’s database.

The success of a retailer relies on how quickly one can act on information. Should we reduce prices? Drop promotions? Transfer inventory?

Management started to track the performance of the store, sales people and product lines in real-time. Most importantly, they were making data-driven decisions faster than ever before.

At the time, not all stores had broadband connection. A few days after
Real-time Sales was implemented on the first store broadband was added to all
stores! It's cool to see a system created back in 2006 with some of the same
elements we might find today in dashboard including gauges, charts and a clean representation of information.

old times.... :)*
