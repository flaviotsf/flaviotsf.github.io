The Realtime Sales was a project I worked on waaay back in 2006. I had the idea
of adding real-time information from some of Mercatto's retail stores.

This system was a huge success. It completly changed the way management would
act on information. Before it, they had to rely on phone calls or simply waiting
the next day to have sales information and act on it (reduce / increase prices,
decide what inventory to send to the store, etc.). With real-time sales they
could track the performance of the store, salespeople and product lines and act
on that information *fast*.

At the time, not all stores had broadband connection in them. A few days after
Realtime Sales was implemented on the first store broadband was added to all
stores! It's cool to see a system created back in 2006 with some of the same
elements we might find today in dashboard including gauges, charts and an easy
representation of information.

*Yes, that is SQL Server 2000 Query Analyzer and Internet Explorer. The good
old times.... haha*
