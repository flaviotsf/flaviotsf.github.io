iXLink was created to facilitate the exchange of price lists between telecom
providers. I had a great time working with an amazing team of people in the
early days of the iXLink tool!

As you may know, Verizon - for example - does not own all the cables and network
between your home and your friend in London. When you place a call, Verizon
needs to identify how it will route your call.

Companies to do using a variety of factors (price, quality, etc.). One of the
biggest challenges in the industry was that - to my surprise at the time - they
used mostly Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to exchange pricing information.

Now, imagine hundreds of companies exchanging excel files and - as you can imagine -
each of them had a different format.

iXLink set to create a standard for companies to exchange price lists. An internal
format was created but pushing a whole industry to move from Excel to an agreed
XML format is challenging. To soften this transition we build a sophisticated system
to define commonalities between price lists and effectively convert them from their
input Excel files into our XML file.

In addition, we build interfaces to allow companies to select their business partners
and also integration with Telarix's iXTools system - that manages prices, routing and
reporting on some of the largest telecom companies in the world.
